Step 0.
The project was created as follows:

seamless-new-project nademo
seamless-load-project-trusted

in the IPython terminal:

import json
graph = json.load(open("initial-port.seamless"))
ctx.add_zip("initial-port.zip")
ctx.set_graph(graph)
ctx.compute()
save()
exit()

rm initial-port.seamless initial-port.zip

Step 1.
The initial webform was generated as follows:

ctx.na_resid.celltype = "int"
ctx.na_resid.share(readonly=False)
ctx.protein_resid.celltype = "int"
ctx.protein_resid.share(readonly=False)
ctx.translate()

Webform.json was modified (see diff).
